I cannot in this time frame keep my only computer in idle and wait it to be done with the password since I have to work with something else. It just takes too long to wait so it might be better with more powerful computer.
I only have my laptop which also has RTX 3050 and i5-12500H. I thought it to be enought, but this process is too heavy
