# Conclusion

- How does attacking differ from the previous assignment?

When it comes to Hydra, it was like zaproxy with extra steps. I did not get it to work first unlike zaproxy, that functioned instantly. Do say it is more complicated, when using Hydra. Burp was most simple one to use, I just needed the time to learn it like the one of the labs at Portswigger. Kali crashed only one time, what was between two burp attacks, which was not as bad as last time it broke itself.

- What would you recommend as a penetration tester to the developer of the application you are testing?

It depends, what kind of developer is in the question. If your want to go easy, when testing any website, then Zaproxy. Else then developer should go for Hydra or Burp.
Burp is the most useful in this experience, but hydra has potential to use more power since it does not need any interface to operate.
