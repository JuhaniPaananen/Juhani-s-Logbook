# Conclusion

- How does attacking differ from the previous assignment?

When it comes to Hydra, it was like zaproxy with extra steps. I did not get it to work first unlike zaproxy, that functioned instantly. Do say it is more complicated, when using Hydra. 

- What would you recommend as a penetration tester to the developer of the application you are testing?

It depends, what kind of developer is in the question. If your want to go easy, when testing any website, then Zaproxy. Else then developer should go for Hydra or Burp.
